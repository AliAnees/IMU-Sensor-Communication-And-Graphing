# IMU Sensor Communication And Graphing
 The purpose of this project was to communicate with an IMU sensor that was connected to a Rasperry Pi. The IMU data was recorded into excel sheets while it was being moved around, and the data was then filtered for noise and graphed. `Python` was used to write the program code. Values were recorded and written to a spreadsheet using `xlwt`, and then `Pandas` and `Matplotlib` libraries were used to filter the data for noise and graph appropriately.
